In my year, we outlined a plan to construct a space telescope out of harvested asteroid materials from 101955 Bennu. I conceptualized and designed using Solidworks space robots for various uses on asteroid, such as mining and transportation, while keeping in mind the effects of microgravity on the dynamics of the robots.

This program is fully funded and requires that the participant is a U.S. citizen. See website for more details: http://nakatani-ries.rice.edu/",

You have to apply in the fall of the previous year and the application process is pretty similar to college applications (i.e. recommendations, essays, etc.). Totally worth it though.",

My research this summer is at Tokyo University in the Maruyama Chiashi laboratory, which is in the Mechanical Engineering department but has a focus on nanoengineering and materials synthesis. Three weeks of Japanese language and culture classes with the other fellows, and nine weeks in different research labs. One of the most unique parts about the program is that they truly care about the students and each participant has many mentors and lots of personal attention, so the whole experience is much more than just research.
